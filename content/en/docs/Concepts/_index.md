This document contains all of the APIs created for the platform partner persona. Platform partners provide different services to OneSource Virtual (OSV) client companies. These APIs enable OSV partners to integrate with the myFlexWallet platform for their user interfaces and systems.

Employee information for OSV customer companies is accessible to partners using these APIs in order to enhance the employee experience with the application and/or platform. 

Employee information is protected by embedding key data in the header or TLS-encrypted payloads.
